== This rylyz-player service provides:
o The rylyz wyjyt.js  [http://rylyz-player.herokuapp.com/assets/rylyz.wyjyt.js]
o The Socket Services (Pusher) that the wyjyt uses
o The rylyz openApp javascript framework
o An example blog page showing a usage of wyjyt.js [http://rylyz-player.herokuapp.com/blogger/blog]


== To start this service on port 80
--> $ sudo apachectl stop
--> $ rvmsudo RAILS_ENV=development  rails s -p80

Running on port 80 leverages the benefits of websockets
When running locally, turn off your default webserver.

== Update /etc/hosts for Dev
When running locally, add the following to your /etc/hosts file
127.0.0.1       rylyz-player.herokuapp.com


== Pusher APP ID
configure pushher app ids in config/environments/xxx.rb
Keep in mind that this server will launch listeners - 
If you start a server in heroku, one in EC2, and one on your local box,
then all 3 servers will be listenting and responding to the same pusher events.

To avoid this - start the server in the correct RAILS_ENV,
Otherwise, register and get your own Pusher APP ID, and create a personal RAILS_ENV
for your own development by copying development.rb and updating the pusher App ID, key and secret
