  Your membership is very valuable to us:
  You are one of our early adopters.
  We know that early adopters are inovative, tech savvy and generally want to play with new things before they become mainstream.
  In fact, early adopters help to decide which of their favorite toys actually become main stream for the rest of the world.

  We are currently a small team, creating this new path.
  Moving in the right direction is important to us.
  We know that your input and interactions will help to guide us toward the right direction.
  So, don't be shy and give us a guiding light anytime you like!
