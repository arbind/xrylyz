+++ TODO

*** unload  display templates:
  - when loading display templates, they get added to the DOM.
    Backbone can then select the templates for each app, screen, display from the dom.
    When rendering, backbone can then render the html into the dom.
    HOWEVER:
    If id selectors are used: <div id="answers" />
    and jquery is use to select the id: $('#answers')
    then the element in the template is getting selected - rather than the elemene that was rendered onto the page using jquery
    (When selecting by id, only the first one is picked)
    Ideally, when a template is requested, it will get attached to the dom, then backbone will select all the templates,
    and then the template should be removed from the dom - so that ID's can properly be used.

*** test logout and login with share_key in the url
then another social account with the same share_key

RELIABILITY
o add client-side retry for lost messages
  add unique message id that increments with every send
  add a try# field to every message that defaults to 1
  add a timeout for the expected response
  return the unique message id on responses to wid's
  if a message response times out, increment the try# and resend.
  when a message is received, cancel the timeout
  notify user of connectivity issues (use indicator in status bar)

UI Framework
o modal prompt

o animation framework

o reset each display on first render
  When playing a game and leaving, then starting a new game.
  the displays show the end of the last game played.
  when showing a display, be have a reset data function prior to rendering

o Create a  ModelReferenceTable for BackBone Models only.
Allow displays to reference a model by name in the ModelReferenceTable
(Instead of creating their own default-empty model)
This will let multiple display's point to the same model.
the server will still update models, by sending updates to a named display,
All other displays referencing that same model should auto-update as well.

o Add ability to name template differently than the model
  %collection{name: 'first-items', template:'items'}
  %collection{name: 'second-items', template:'items'}
  %collection{name: 'third-items', template:'items'}
  Above 3 examples all have different data bindings, but render using the same template

o Allow conditional rendering of an object
  %object{name: 'card', condition: '[[already-played]]'}
    %html goes here for already played item
  %object{name: 'card', condition: '![[already-played]]'}
    %html goes here for item that hasen't been played
  or
  %collection{name: 'some-items', condition: 'empty'}
    %html goes here for empty collection
  %collection{name: 'some-items', condition: 'not-empty'}
    %html goes here for non-empty collection

o Create a conditional navigation for click events.
Say you want to navigate to the chat room screen on click,
if you have already registerd your name, then nav to chat room screen
else nav to registration screen first to enter name, then to the chat room screen

o prepopulate form data with model

o Create a wizard which has many screens bound to the same model set
(May also be able to use this for the conditional navigation)
  + model set (maybe one root model?)
  + screen set (all the screens in the wizard)
  + rule set - specify screen flow logic

Services:
o login: username, facebook, twitter, google+
o invite friends to a game
o share post
o store: gifts, identity
o purchase: mobile payment, paypal, credit card, others?
o subscription: (same options)
o leader-board
o achievments
o persistence: mongoDB

o To Fix Request-URI Too Large:
  After a successfull login using OPENID to signin with Yahoo, you may get "Request-URI Too Large" error.
  You can reconfigure the threshhold in your webserver.
  For webrick: update a config file somewhere in: 
  ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httprequest.rb 
  search for: RequestURITooLarge and change the max value to: 8192 instead of 1024
