    After all, we want you to have as many visitors as possible.
    Them more visitors you have the more people will play games and make purchases, and the more profits there will be for us to share.
    Its a win, win, win.

    Don't have a website?
    If you don't have a website or blog, we encourage you to get one going!
    There are a lot of great ways to start a website:
    Try tumblr or blogspot.
    You can still go ahead and register with the above link.
    Add your url anytime you want.

  
  Let us know if you want to be an alpha tester.
  We are working towards our alpha release.
  include cost, profit sharing rate, clicks, signups.
  We'd like to start setting up for our early adopters (which you are)
  If you would like to offer social games to people who visit your website(s),
  please go ahead and register the url(s) that you will use.
  You can register as many sites as you want with your account.

  We are going to start by creating a simple chat app that you can add to your site.
  your visitors will be able to chat with each other, and with you!

  The chat app will help us to solidify our messaging architecture and development framework. 
  It's the same platform that will be used by all of our games.
  As and early adopter, your participation will help us to form our service and to get to profit sharing sooner!


  Increase your total profit sharing:
  <share url>
  http://rylyz.com/play?lrRef=<share_code>
  Tweet it, share it, post it to forums, make blog comment and email to webmasters you know:
  Your base profit sharing will go up for each active referral.


  Your membership is very valuable to us:
  You are one of our early adopters.
  We know that early adopters are inovative, tech savvy and generally want to play with new things before they become mainstream.
  In fact, early adopters help to decide which of their favorite toys actually become main stream for the rest of the world.

  We are currently a small team, creating this new path.
  Moving in the right direction is important to us.
  We know that your input and interactions will help to guide us toward the right direction.
  So, don't be shy and give us a guiding light anytime you like!

RELIABILITY
o add client-side retry for lost messages
  add unique message id that increments with every send
  add a try# field to every message that defaults to 1
  add a timeout for the expected response
  return the unique message id on responses to wid's
  if a message response times out, increment the try# and resend.
  when a message is received, cancel the timeout
  notify user of connectivity issues (use indicator in status bar)

UI Framework
o modal prompt

o animation framework

o reset each display on first render
  When playing a game and leaving, then starting a new game.
  the displays show the end of the last game played.
  when showing a display, be have a reset data function prior to rendering

o Create a  ModelReferenceTable for BackBone Models only.
Allow displays to reference a model by name in the ModelReferenceTable
(Instead of creating their own default-empty model)
This will let multiple display's point to the same model.
the server will still update models, by sending updates to a named display,
All other displays referencing that same model should auto-update as well.

o Create a conditional navigation for click events.
Say you want to navigate to the chat room screen on click,
if you have already registerd your name, then nav to chat room screen
else nav to registration screen first to enter name, then to the chat room screen

o prepopulate form data with model

o Create a wizard which has many screens bound to the same model set
(May also be able to use this for the conditional navigation)
  + model set (maybe one root model?)
  + screen set (all the screens in the wizard)
  + rule set - specify screen flow logic

Services:
o login: username, facebook, twitter, google+
o invite friends to a game
o share post
o store: gifts, identity
o purchase: mobile payment, paypal, credit card, others?
o subscription: (same options)
o leader-board
o achievments
o persistence: mongoDB

o To Fix Request-URI Too Large:
  After a successfull login using OPENID to signin with Yahoo, you may get "Request-URI Too Large" error.
  You can reconfigure the threshhold in your webserver.
  For webrick: update a config file somewhere in: 
  ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httprequest.rb 
  search for: RequestURITooLarge and change the max value to: 8192 instead of 1024
