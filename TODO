UI Framework
o modal modal prompt

o animation framework

o Create a  ModelReferenceTable for BackBone Models only.
Allow displays to reference a model by name in the ModelReferenceTable
(Instead of creating their own default-empty model)
This will let multiple display's point to the same model.
the server will still update models, by sending updates to a named display,
All other displays referencing that same model should auto-update as well.

o Create a conditional navigation for click events.
Say you want to navigate to the chat room screen on click,
if you have already registerd your name, then nav to chat room screen
else nav to registration screen first to enter name, then to the chat room screen

o prepopulate form data with model

o Create a wizard which has many screens bound to the same model set
(May also be able to use this for the conditional navigation)
  + model set (maybe one root model?)
  + screen set (all the screens in the wizard)
  + rule set - specify screen flow logic

Services:
o login: username, facebook, twitter, google+
o invite friends to a game
o share post
o store: gifts, identity
o purchase: mobile payment, paypal, credit card, others?
o subscription: (same options)
o leader-board
o achievments
o persistence: mongoDB
