/*
  Button structure is consistent for both link buttons and form submit buttons
  (all buttons will be wrapped by ether a link <a> or a form submit button tag)
  
  button wrapped in a form submit: (works even if js is disabled)
  <button type="submit">
    log In
  </button>

  button wrapped in a link tag:
  <a href="/signup">
    <button>register</button>
  </a>
